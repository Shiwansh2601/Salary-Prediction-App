# 💼 **Salary Prediction App**

## 🚀 Overview
This repository hosts a **web-based Salary Prediction App** built using **Streamlit** and an **Ensemble Learning model**. The app predicts salaries based on key user inputs like age, education level, experience, and job title. It showcases the full machine learning pipeline—from **data preprocessing and model training** to **frontend deployment**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📊 Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a seamless experience.
- **🔍 Ensemble Model:** Utilizes a pre-trained model (`salary_prediction_model.pkl`) for high prediction accuracy.
- **🎛️ Input Parameters:** User inputs like age, experience, education, and job title.
- **📘 Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks document data exploration, model comparison, and model building.
- **📂 Data-Driven:** Trained on `Salary_Data.csv` for real-world relevance.
